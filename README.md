Coming up with the content was easy cause i already had a brilliant person in mind whose biograpgy was well documented online.
Getting Started
Documentation in building a Tribute Website For Condolezza Rice.
Adding the appropriate html tags and making the website responsive by adding the appropriate metat data.
Linking the external stylesheet in the head section of the html document
Adding the header section and making use of the heading tags where necessary.
Dividing each section of the website with div tags for easy identification and styling
Using the blockquote tag  to indicate the section of the text from goodreads.com
Sourcing for the right picture;Finding the appropriate image to use was a bit daunting, because, the img element should be able to responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
 centering the image; I had to center the img element  with its parent element.
 Writing the tribute extracted from different pages online and arranging them using p tags.
 Then finally adding the footer and done with page struturing with html.
 I now proceeded with styling in CSS
 First was to add color using the desired background-color and applying margins.
 stylying the heading tags (h1 and h5) and title
 setting all p tags with desired font style.
 styling the main page of the website , setting the fonts, width, height and justifying the text
 positioning the image at the center of the page.
 For adding the shadow effect around the tribute section of the page, i used box-shadow so as to distinguish the section from other sections of the website.
 Finally, adding the color, setting the margins and paddings and then justifying the text.
